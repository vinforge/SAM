- 32% cost reduction vs 5:1 alternatives
- Consistent performance across context lengths
- Strong theoretical foundation

**Impact**: $10,000+ training cost savings while maintaining target performance

### 2. Training Strategy: Curriculum Learning
**Decision**: Gradual context length scaling (4K → 8K → 16K → 32K → 64K → 100K)

**Rationale**:
