Implementation Plan: Upgrading Agent Zero with LLM-Guided A* Search
Project Goal: To replace Agent Zero's current sequential reasoning planner with the A* search algorithm, using the core LLM as a heuristic function. This will transform Agent Zero into a strategic, forward-thinking planner capable of finding optimal action sequences for complex tasks.
Phase 1: Foundational Components & Data Structures
Objective: To build the core, reusable components of the A* search framework. This phase does not involve the LLM yet.
Create the PlanningState Data Class:
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/state.py
Action: Define a dataclass or Pydantic model named PlanningState. This object will represent a "node" in our search tree.
Fields:
task_description: str (The original user goal)
action_history: List[str] (The sequence of actions taken to reach this state)
current_observation: str (The result of the last action)
parent: Optional[PlanningState] (A reference to the previous state)
g_score: int (The cost to reach this state, e.g., len(action_history))
Implement the SearchNode Wrapper:
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/search_node.py
Action: Create another dataclass to wrap the PlanningState for the search algorithm.
Fields:
state: PlanningState
h_score: int (The estimated cost-to-go, will be populated by the LLM later)
f_score: int (The total score: g_score + h_score)
Method: Implement comparison methods (__lt__, __eq__) based on f_score so these nodes can be sorted in a priority queue.
Implement the Priority Queue (Frontier):
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/frontier.py
Action: Create a Frontier class that wraps Python's heapq module.
Methods: add(node: SearchNode), pop() -> SearchNode, is_empty() -> bool. This provides a clean interface for managing the list of potential paths to explore.
Phase 2: The LLM Heuristic & Action Expansion Modules
Objective: To create the two critical modules where the LLM interacts with the planning algorithm.
Develop the Heuristic Estimation Module (h-function):
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/heuristic_estimator.py
Action: Create a class HeuristicEstimator.
Method: estimate_cost_to_go(state: PlanningState) -> int.
Inside this method, construct the specific, low-token heuristic prompt as described in the paper.
Make a call to SAM's core LLM interface with this prompt.
Parse the LLM's response to extract the integer value.
Include robust error handling (e.g., if the LLM doesn't return a number, default to a high value).
Develop the Action Expansion Module (expand-function):
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/action_expander.py
Action: Create a class ActionExpander.
Method: get_next_possible_actions(state: PlanningState) -> List[str].
This method uses a different prompt, asking the LLM to propose a list of concrete, single next steps from the current state.
Example Prompt: "Goal: [...]. Current State: [...]. Based on the available tools [list of tools], what are the next possible actions? Provide a list of actions."
Parse the LLM's response to get a list of potential tool calls (e.g., ["search_flights(destination='Paris')", "check_hotel_prices(city='Paris')"]).
Phase 3: The A* Planner Integration
Objective: To assemble the components from Phase 1 and 2 into a fully functional A* planning loop and integrate it into Agent Zero.
Build the A* Planner Class:
File: sam/agent_zero/planning/a_star_planner.py
Action: Create the main AStarPlanner class.
Method: find_optimal_plan(initial_prompt: str, available_tools: List[Tool]) -> List[str].
Logic: This method will contain the main A* search loop:
Initialize the Frontier with the starting SearchNode.
Initialize a visited_states set to avoid cycles.
Loop while not frontier.is_empty():
a. current_node = frontier.pop()
b. Check if current_node.state meets the goal condition. If yes, reconstruct the action history from the parent pointers and return the plan.
c. Use the ActionExpander to get the next possible actions.
d. For each action, create a new PlanningState.
e. Use the HeuristicEstimator to calculate h_score for the new state.
f. Create a new SearchNode and add() it to the frontier.
Integrate with Agent Zero:
Action: Modify the entry point of AgentZero.
New Flow:
When Agent Zero receives a task, it first calls a_star_planner.find_optimal_plan().
This call returns a list of actions (the optimal plan).
Agent Zero's existing execution engine then iterates through this list, executing each tool call in sequence. The execution part doesn't need to change, only the initial planning part.
Phase 4: Synergy Integration & Advanced Features (Follow-on)
Objective: To connect the new planner with SAM's other advanced systems for a truly intelligent, self-improving agent.
TPV Control: Wrap the while not frontier.is_empty() loop in Phase 3 with the TPV Active Reasoning Control. TPV can monitor the "planning progress" (e.g., how much the best f_score in the frontier is improving) and halt the planning if it stagnates, forcing the agent to proceed with the best plan found so far.
Episodic Memory for Heuristics: Enhance the HeuristicEstimator. Before returning the LLM's raw estimate, it should query SAM's Phase 6 Episodic Memory for past outcomes of similar actions. If history shows a certain tool is unreliable, the estimator can artificially inflate the h_score, teaching the planner to be wary of that tool.
Meta-Reasoning Review: After a plan is generated but before execution, have the Phase 5 Reflective Meta-Reasoning Engine perform a final review. It can add a "qualitative" check on the "quantitative" optimality of the plan (e.g., flagging potential risks or ethical concerns).
Testing & Validation Plan
Unit Tests: Each new class (PlanningState, SearchNode, Frontier, HeuristicEstimator, ActionExpander) must have its own unit tests.
Integration Tests:
Test the AStarPlanner with a mock LLM to ensure the search algorithm itself is correct.
Create a suite of test problems, from simple two-step tasks to complex, multi-branching tasks.
A/B Comparison: Run this new A* planner against the old sequential planner on the test suite.
Metrics:
Task Success Rate.
Total Tokens Consumed (for both planning and execution).
Number of Tool Calls (a measure of efficiency).
Final Plan Optimality (human-judged).
This comprehensive plan provides a clear, step-by-step path to fundamentally upgrading Agent Zero into a state-of-the-art autonomous planning agent.
