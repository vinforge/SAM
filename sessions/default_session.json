Hmm, this seems like a common beginner mistake where people might forget to attach context or assume I already know what they're referring to.\n\nFirst, I need to interpret what they mean by \"resume the story.\" It could be:\n- A request to summarize a previously mentioned story (but none was mentioned)\n- A request to continue telling a story that started elsewhere (which didn't start here)\n- Or maybe they meant \"resume\" as in \"recount\" or \"relate\" without specifying content.\n\nThe user might be:\n- Someone new to using AI assistants, unfamiliar with how to frame requests properly\n- In a hurry and didn't bother pasting the story\n- Thinking I have context from a previous conversation (but this is a new session)\n\nI should respond helpfully but gently correct the misunderstanding. The best approach is:\n1. Acknowledge their request\n2. Politely point out the lack of context\n3. Offer to summarize if they provide the story\n4. Keep it neutral to avoid sounding condescending\n\nThe response should be clear but not assume too much - just a simple prompt for them to provide the story they want summarized. No need to overcomplicate it unless they give more context about what they mean by \"resume.\"\n</think>\nOkay, I'm ready to help!\n\nCould you please provide the story you want me to summarize?\n\nOnce you give me the text or describe the story, I'll provide a comprehensive and helpful summary for you.",
