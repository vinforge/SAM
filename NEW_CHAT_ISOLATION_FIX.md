# New Chat Isolation Fix

## Problem Description

When users clicked the "New Chat" button in SAM, historic chat data was still interfering with the new conversation. Even though the conversation buffer was cleared and the UI showed a fresh chat, SAM would still consider previous chat information when generating responses.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `generate_draft_response` function in `secure_streamlit_app.py`. The sequence of operations was:

1. ✅ User clicks "New Chat" 
2. ✅ Current conversation gets archived
3. ✅ Conversation buffer gets cleared (`session_manager.clear_session()`)
4. ✅ UI chat history gets cleared (`st.session_state.chat_history = []`)
5. ❌ **PROBLEM**: When generating a response to the first question in the new chat:
   - Current user prompt gets added to conversation buffer
   - Conversation history gets retrieved (including the current prompt)
   - This history gets passed to the LLM

This meant that even in a "new chat", the LLM would see conversation context (at minimum, the current prompt in the conversation history).

## The Fix

### Primary Fix: Reorder Operations in `generate_draft_response`

**File**: `secure_streamlit_app.py` (lines 7864-7898)

**Before**:
```python
# Add user turn to conversation buffer (use original prompt for history)
session_manager.add_turn(session_id, 'user', prompt)

# Get formatted conversation history
conversation_history = session_manager.format_conversation_history(session_id, max_turns=8)
```

**After**:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Get conversation history BEFORE adding current prompt
# This ensures that new chats start with empty history
conversation_history = session_manager.format_conversation_history(session_id, max_turns=8)

# Now add user turn to conversation buffer for future context
session_manager.add_turn(session_id, 'user', prompt)
```

### Secondary Fix: Enhanced Session State Cleanup

**File**: `secure_streamlit_app.py` (lines 1231-1241)

Added comprehensive cleanup when starting a new chat:

```python
# Clear chat history and conversation context
st.session_state.chat_history = []
st.session_state.conversation_history = ""

# Clear any conversation metadata that might interfere
if 'conversation_archived' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state['conversation_archived']
if 'conversation_resumed' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state['conversation_resumed']
if 'last_relevance_check' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state['last_relevance_check']
```

## How It Works Now

### New Chat Flow:
1. User clicks "New Chat"
2. Current conversation gets archived
3. Conversation buffer gets cleared
4. Session state gets cleaned
5. **When user asks first question in new chat**:
   - Conversation history is retrieved BEFORE adding current prompt → **Empty history**
   - Empty history is passed to LLM → **No interference from previous chats**
   - Current prompt is added to buffer for future context

### Ongoing Chat Flow:
1. User asks a question
2. Conversation history is retrieved (contains previous messages in current chat)
3. Current prompt is added to buffer
4. History + current context is passed to LLM → **Proper context awareness**

## Verification

Created and ran `test_new_chat_isolation.py` which verifies:

1. ✅ **Conversation Isolation**: New chats start with empty conversation history
2. ✅ **History Order**: Conversation history is retrieved before adding current prompt
3. ✅ **Context Preservation**: Within a chat, conversation context is properly maintained

## Impact

- ✅ **New chats are truly isolated** - no interference from previous conversations
- ✅ **Context chat history is preserved** - ongoing conversations maintain proper context
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ **Performance maintained** - no additional overhead

## Files Modified

1. `secure_streamlit_app.py`:
   - Lines 7864-7898: Reordered conversation buffer operations
   - Lines 1231-1241: Enhanced session state cleanup

2. `test_new_chat_isolation.py`: 
   - New test file to verify the fix works correctly

## Testing

Run the test to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_new_chat_isolation.py
```

Expected output: All tests should pass, confirming that new chat isolation is working correctly.
