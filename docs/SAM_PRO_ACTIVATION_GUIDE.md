## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Key distribution system not available"
**Solution**: Ensure all SAM components are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py  # If available
```

#### "Email delivery failed"
**Possible Causes**:

**Solution**: Your key will still be displayed in the terminal/interface as backup.

#### "Invalid activation key"
**Possible Causes**:
- Typo in key entry
- Key not properly generated
- Keystore corruption

**Solution**: 
1. Double-check the key format (UUID with hyphens)
2. Generate a new key if needed
3. Contact support: vin@forge1825.net

### Manual Key Validation
```bash
python -c "
import json
with open('security/keystore.json', 'r') as f:
    keys = json.load(f)
    print('Active keys:', len(keys))
    for key in list(keys.keys())[:3]:
        print(f'  {key}')
"
```

### Reset Keystore (if corrupted)
```bash
# Backup existing keystore
cp security/keystore.json security/keystore_backup.json
