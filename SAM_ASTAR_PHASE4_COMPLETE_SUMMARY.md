- **Self-Improving**: Learns from experience to enhance future planning
- **Self-Aware**: Validates plans for safety, ethics, and strategic soundness
- **Adaptive**: Continuously evolves planning capabilities based on outcomes

## ðŸŽ¯ **Real-World Planning Scenarios**

### **Document Analysis with Cognitive Enhancement**
```
Traditional Plan: [analyze_document, extract_insights, create_response]

Cognitive Enhanced Plan:
1. TPV Control: Monitors progress, detects if analysis is stagnating
2. Episodic Learning: "Similar documents took 4 actions, adjust estimate"
3. Meta-Reasoning: "Plan lacks verification step, suggest adding validation"
4. Final Plan: [analyze_structure, deep_analyze, validate_findings, create_response]
```

### **Research Task with Safety Validation**
```
Initial Plan: [web_search, download_papers, analyze_content]

Cognitive Validation:
- Risk Assessment: "download_papers" flagged as potentially risky
- Strategic Analysis: Missing synthesis step
- Alternative Suggestion: Use arxiv_search instead of direct downloads
- Enhanced Plan: [arxiv_search, analyze_abstracts, synthesize_findings]
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Integration Points**
