# LLM-Guided A* Search Planning in SAM: Strategic Intelligence Through Optimal Path Finding

## Abstract

This document presents the implementation of an LLM-guided A* search planner within the SAM (Strategic AI Model) framework, representing a fundamental advancement from reactive to proactive artificial intelligence. The system transforms SAM from a response-based agent into a strategic planning entity capable of optimal action sequence generation for complex multi-step tasks. Through the integration of classical A* search algorithms with large language model heuristics, SAM achieves unprecedented strategic intelligence while maintaining computational efficiency and context awareness.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional AI systems, including advanced language models, operate primarily in reactive modes—responding to immediate queries without strategic foresight. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning, resource optimization, and long-term planning. The integration of A* search algorithms with LLM-based heuristics addresses this fundamental limitation by enabling SAM to:

- **Plan Optimal Action Sequences**: Generate minimal-cost paths to goal states
- **Leverage Context Strategically**: Utilize documents, memory, and conversation history in planning
- **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Minimize computational overhead while maximizing outcome quality
- **Scale to Complex Tasks**: Handle increasingly sophisticated multi-step scenarios

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundation

The implementation builds upon the classical A* search algorithm, enhanced with LLM-based heuristic functions. A* search guarantees optimal solutions when the heuristic function is admissible (never overestimates the true cost). By employing SAM's core LLM as the heuristic estimator, the system achieves:

**f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**

Where:
- **g(n)**: Actual cost from start to node n
- **h(n)**: LLM-estimated cost from node n to goal
- **f(n)**: Total estimated cost of path through n

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

The A* planner implementation consists of four primary phases, each building upon the previous:

#### Phase 1: Foundational Data Structures
- **PlanningState**: Represents nodes in the search tree with comprehensive context
- **SearchNode**: Wrapper containing A* search metadata (f-score, g-score, h-score)
- **Frontier**: Priority queue implementing efficient node management

#### Phase 1.5: SAM Context Integration
- **SAMToolRegistry**: Catalog of 16 tools across 6 categories for action mapping
- **StateSimilarityDetector**: Optimization through intelligent state comparison
- **SAMContextManager**: Unified context handling for documents, memory, and conversation

#### Phase 2: LLM-Based Intelligence
- **HeuristicEstimator**: LLM-powered cost-to-go estimation with context awareness
- **ActionExpander**: LLM-driven action generation using SAM's capability registry

#### Phase 3: Integrated Planning System
- **AStarPlanner**: Complete A* search implementation with SAM integration
- **SAMPlannerIntegration**: Interface layer for seamless SAM system integration

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 State Representation

The PlanningState class encapsulates all information necessary for strategic planning:

```python
@dataclass
class PlanningState:
    task_description: str                    # Original goal
    action_history: List[str]               # Actions taken
    current_observation: str                # Latest result
    parent: Optional['PlanningState']       # Path reconstruction
    g_score: int                           # Actual cost
    
    # SAM-specific context
    document_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]      # Available documents
    memory_context: Optional[List[str]]             # Relevant memories
    conversation_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # Chat history
```

### 3.2 LLM-Based Heuristic Estimation

The HeuristicEstimator employs carefully crafted prompts to extract cost estimates from SAM's LLM:

**Prompt Structure**:
1. Task description and current state
2. Available context (documents, memory, conversation)
3. Action history and current observation
4. Estimation instructions with constraints

**Response Processing**:
- Numerical extraction with validation
- Confidence assessment based on response clarity
- Fallback estimation for parsing failures
- Caching for performance optimization

### 3.3 Action Space Exploration

The ActionExpander generates contextually relevant actions through:

**Tool Registry Integration**: Maps SAM's capabilities to planning actions across categories:
- Document Analysis (4 tools)
- Memory Operations (3 tools)
- Research Tools (3 tools)
- Conversation Tools (2 tools)
- Synthesis Tools (2 tools)
- Reasoning Tools (2 tools)

**LLM-Guided Expansion**: Generates action suggestions based on:
- Current task requirements
- Available context and resources
- Historical action effectiveness
- Tool prerequisite satisfaction

### 3.4 Search Algorithm Implementation

The core A* search loop implements:

```python
while not frontier.is_empty():
    current_node = frontier.pop()
    
    if is_goal_state(current_node.state):
        return reconstruct_path(current_node)
    
    for action in expand_actions(current_node.state):
        child_state = apply_action(current_node.state, action)
        h_score = estimate_cost_to_go(child_state)
        child_node = create_child_node(current_node, action, h_score)
        frontier.add(child_node)
```
